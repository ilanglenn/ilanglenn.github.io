Margaret MacMillan: "We can learn from history, but we can also deceive ourselves when we selectively take evidence from the past to justify what we have already made up our minds to do." “Data” is kind of history; when “data” meets “analytics”, they help people make informed decisions from past experience and stop guessing. I loved data science since I discovered my passion for numbers and data. I pull data, set up a mathematical model, develop algorithm, and analyze data: a chain I solve real-world issues by science. Working in the tech industry will be the best opportunity to face nowaday issues: what problems people really meet and what matters people really need.
